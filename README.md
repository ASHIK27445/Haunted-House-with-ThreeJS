## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation  
![Zombie Animation](/5.png)  
*Animated zombie character with walking cycle*  

The project utilizes several advanced computer graphics techniques:  
- **Texture Mapping**: Diffuse, normal, displacement, and ambient occlusion maps  
- **Shadow Mapping**: Real-time shadow calculation for multiple light sources  
- **Procedural Animation**: Trigonometric functions for ghost light movement  
- **Skeletal Animation**: GLTF-based character animations  
- **Camera Systems**: Multiple camera modes including orbit and follow cameras
